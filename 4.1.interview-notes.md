# Notes

2. 
- UNIQUE: allow NULL, two rows with NULL in a UNIQUE column are permitted.
- INDEX: However, while indexes improve read performance, they may slow down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the database needs to update the index whenever the data in the indexed columns changes.

5. B+ Tree: A B+ Tree is a self-balancing tree.
- Clustered Index (Primary Index)
```
B+ Tree Structure:
[Root]
  └── [Intermediate Nodes]
        └── [Leaf Nodes: Contain Full Table Rows]
```
- Secondary Index (Non-Clustered Index)
```
B+ Tree Structure:
[Root]
  └── [Intermediate Nodes]
        └── [Leaf Nodes: Contain Indexed Values + Primary Key References]
```

7. A transaction in SQL is a sequence of one or more SQL operations treated as a single unit of work.
- Atomicity: all or nothing.
- Consistency: a consistent state before and after the transaction.
- Isolation: Intermediate states of a transaction are not visible to others.
- Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent

8. A view is created using a SELECT statement. It does not store data.

9. A Stored Procedure in SQL is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements

10. A trigger in SQL is a special type of stored procedure that is automatically executed
